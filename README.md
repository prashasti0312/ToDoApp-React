ToDoApp-React:
I have tried my hands on React and made a simple To-Do list web app. It is extremely easy to use, with a simple UI. In this application, I've used React components, React forms, event handlers etc. Get your hands on this simple yet amazing application so that next time you won't forget what all you have to do in the day. 

Front-End Part:
For the front-end, I have used HTML5, CSS3, React JS and Redux. 

Back-End Part:
For back-end I have used Node.js. 

I have deployed the app online. The link for the same:
